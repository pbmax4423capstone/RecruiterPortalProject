Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations on completing your Career Interview! I'm pleased to let you know that you've advanced to the Alignment stage.

The Alignment interview is designed to:
• Ensure mutual fit between you and Capstone
• Discuss compensation structure and earning potential
• Review our training and development programs
• Address any remaining questions or concerns

This is a great opportunity to see if our values, culture, and business model align with what you're looking for in your career.

I'll be in touch soon to schedule your Alignment meeting. Please come prepared with any questions about compensation, training, or day-to-day operations.

We're excited about your progress!

Best regards,

Rachyll Tenny
Chief Talent Officer
