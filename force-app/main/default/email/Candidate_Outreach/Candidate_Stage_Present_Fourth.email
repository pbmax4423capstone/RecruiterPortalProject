Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

You're doing great! You've reached the Presentation stage - one of the final steps before joining our team.

During the Presentation stage:
• You'll present your business plan to our leadership team
• We'll discuss your vision and goals in detail
• You'll have the opportunity to demonstrate your commitment and preparation
• Our team will provide feedback and answer final questions

This is your chance to showcase your potential and solidify the mutual decision to move forward.

To prepare:
• Review and refine your business plan
• Practice presenting your goals and strategy
• Prepare thoughtful questions for leadership
• Be ready to discuss your timeline for getting started

I'll send calendar details shortly. You've come a long way - let's finish strong!

Best regards,
