# Email Response to Rachel Tenney - ATS Capabilities

**Subject: RE: ATS Capabilities - Addressing Your Concerns**

**Status:** Draft - Ready to Send  
**Date Drafted:** December 19, 2025

Hi Rachel,

Thank you for laying out your concerns so clearly. I want to address each of your three functional gaps directly, because we've built custom solutions within Salesforce that address all of these exact needs.

**1. LinkedIn One-Click Sourcing → Salesforce**

✅ **Solved.** We've built a custom Chrome and Edge browser extension that does exactly this. When you're on a LinkedIn profile, you click one button and the candidate's information (name, title, company, location, LinkedIn URL) is automatically created as a new Candidate record in Salesforce. No copy/paste, no manual data entry. One click.

**2. Auto-Draft Mass Emails Synced with Outlook**

✅ **Solved.** We've built automated email flows that trigger at each stage of the candidate lifecycle. When a candidate moves through stages, templated emails are automatically sent. Our Salesforce instance is already integrated directly with Outlook, so all correspondence syncs seamlessly. The templates are ready—we just need your preferred wording and we can plug them right in.

**3. Visual Stage Movement with Funnel Metrics**

✅ **Solved.** We've built two custom dashboards:

- **Recruiter Dashboard**: Shows your candidate pipeline with visual status tracking, interview counts, and conversion metrics
- **Contract B Pipeline Dashboard**: Tracks agents through the entire lifecycle from Active Learning Commitment through Contract B completion, showing exactly where candidates are in the funnel and where drop-off occurs

These dashboards show:
- YTD Recruiting Metrics (hires, terminations, net gain)
- Candidates by status with visual progress indicators
- Interview completion rates
- FYC and submission tracking
- Extension tracking and coaching alerts

**Cost Comparison**

| | LOXO | Our Salesforce ATS |
|---|---|---|
| Annual Cost | $7,700/year (recurring) | $0 (already built) |
| LinkedIn Integration | Yes | ✅ Yes (Chrome/Edge extension) |
| Automated Emails | Yes | ✅ Yes (Flow + Outlook integration) |
| Pipeline Visualization | Yes | ✅ Yes (Custom dashboards) |
| Existing Data | Requires migration | ✅ Already in Salesforce |
| Learning Curve | New system | ✅ Same platform you know |

**The Bottom Line**

All three of your functional gaps have been addressed. The solutions are deployed and ready to use today at no additional cost. We're not adding friction—we've removed it, using the platform we already have.

**My Ask**

I'd like to show you a 30-minute demo of what we've built. I think you'll see that everything you need is already here.

Would you have time this week for a quick walkthrough?

Best,
Pat
