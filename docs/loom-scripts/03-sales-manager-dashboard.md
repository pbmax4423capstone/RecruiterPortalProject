---

### [0:20-0:40] HEADER SECTION & GREETING

**[Show: Top of dashboard with personalized greeting]**

**Voiceover:**  
"At the very top, you'll see a personalized greeting based on the time of day—'Good Morning,' 'Good Afternoon,' or 'Good Evening'—followed by your first name. Just below that are five action buttons we've covered in previous videos: Create Support Ticket, Schedule Call, Reschedule Calls, Create New Candidate, and Schedule Interview."

**[Action: Hover briefly over each button]**

---

### [0:40-1:20] CALL MANAGEMENT SECTION (TOP PRIORITY)

**[Show: Call management cards at top of dashboard]**

**Voiceover:**  
"The first section you'll see is Call Management—this is positioned at the top because it requires immediate attention. You'll see three metrics here."

**[Action: Highlight each card as you describe]**

**1. Scheduled Calls**  
**Voiceover:**  
"First, 'Scheduled Calls'—this shows how many calls you have coming up today and in the near future. These are tasks assigned to you with a due date."

**[Show: Click on the number to open a modal or list of scheduled calls]**

**Voiceover (continued):**

**2. Past Due Calls**  
**Voiceover:**  
"Next is 'Past Due Calls'—these are calls that were scheduled but didn't get completed on time. This number should ideally be zero. If you see past due calls, prioritize completing or rescheduling them immediately."

**[Show: Highlight past due count]**

**3. Total Assigned Calls**  
**Voiceover:**  
"Finally, 'Total Assigned' shows all calls assigned to you regardless of status—scheduled, completed, or past due. This gives you a sense of your overall workload."

## Key Points to Emphasize

1. ✅ **Call Management is top priority** - Past due calls should be zero
2. ✅ **Clickable metrics** - Every card opens detailed lists
3. ✅ **Current Month vs YTD toggle** - Use for different time perspectives
4. ✅ **Interview types matter** - Track progression through Attraction → SI1 → SI2 → SI3
5. ✅ **At Risk agents need attention** - Contract B monitoring is critical
6. ✅ **Dashboard is interactive** - Click through to candidate records
7. ✅ **Auto-refresh** - Data updates periodically

---

## Common Mistakes to Address

- ❌ Ignoring past due calls (should be completed or rescheduled)
- ❌ Confusing "Active" candidates with "Leads" (different pipeline stages)
- ❌ Not toggling to YTD for long-term trend analysis
- ❌ Overlooking "At Risk" Contract B agents until too late
- ❌ Not clicking through metrics to see detailed lists
- ❌ Forgetting to check "Scheduled Interviews" for pipeline management
