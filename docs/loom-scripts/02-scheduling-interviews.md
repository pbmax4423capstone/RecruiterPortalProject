## Video Script with Voiceover

### [0:00-0:15] INTRODUCTION

**[Show: Dashboard home page]**

**Voiceover:**  
"Welcome back to the Recruiter Portal training series. In this video, I'll show you how to schedule interviews with candidates. This process is streamlined to take less than a minute once you know where everything is."

---

### [0:15-0:35] LOCATING THE SCHEDULE INTERVIEW BUTTON

**[Action: Hover over header buttons, highlight "Schedule Interview" button (5th button)]**

**Voiceover:**  
"From your dashboard, look at the action buttons in the header. The fifth button says 'Schedule Interview'—this is what you'll use every time you need to book an interview with a candidate, whether it's their first call or a follow-up meeting."

**[Action: Click "Schedule Interview" button]**

---

### [0:35-0:55] MODAL OPENS - FORM OVERVIEW

**[Show: Schedule Interview modal with empty form]**

**Voiceover:**  
"The Schedule Interview form opens as a modal. You'll see several fields here. The three required fields are: Candidate, Interview Type, and Scheduled Date/Time—these are marked with red asterisks. Let's walk through the process step by step."

---

### [0:55-1:25] FIELD 1: CANDIDATE (REQUIRED LOOKUP)

**[Action: Click into Candidate lookup field, show search functionality]**

**Voiceover:**  
"First, select the candidate you're scheduling with. Click into the Candidate field—this is a lookup field. You can start typing the candidate's name to search."

**[Action: Type a few letters, show dropdown of matching candidates]**

**Voiceover (continued):**  
"As you type, you'll see matching candidates appear in the dropdown. Click on the correct candidate to select them. This links the interview directly to their candidate record."

**[Action: Select a candidate from dropdown]**

**Voiceover (continued):**  
"Once selected, you'll see their full name displayed in the field."

---

### [1:25-2:15] FIELD 2: INTERVIEW TYPE (REQUIRED DROPDOWN)

**[Action: Click Interview Type dropdown, show all options]**

**Voiceover:**  
"Next, select the Interview Type. This tells the system which stage of the interview process this is. Click the dropdown to see all available types."

**[Action: Scroll through dropdown showing each option with brief pause:]**

**On screen as you scroll:**
- **Attraction Interview (Ci-First)** - "This is the initial contact call"
- **SI1 (Align-2nd)** - "First structured interview"
- **SI2 (Plan-3rd)** - "Second structured interview"
- **SI3 (Present-4th)** - "Third structured interview"
- **Career (Optional-5th)** - "Career presentation meeting"

**Voiceover:**  
"Let me explain each type:

- **Attraction Interview**—also called 'Ci-First'—is your initial contact call with the candidate. This is typically a phone screen to gauge interest.

- **SI1**—'Align-2nd'—is your first structured interview. This is usually a deeper dive into qualifications.

- **SI2**—'Plan-3rd'—is the second structured interview, often covering career goals and expectations.

- **SI3**—'Present-4th'—is the third structured interview, usually focused on presenting the opportunity in detail.

- **Career**—'Optional-5th'—is a career presentation meeting. Not all candidates go through this stage.

Most of the time, you'll start with 'Attraction Interview' for new candidates."

**[Action: Select "Attraction Interview"]**

### [2:15-3:00] FIELD 3: SCHEDULED DATE/TIME (REQUIRED)

**[Action: Set time to "2:00 PM"]**

**[Show: Complete date/time displayed, e.g., "1/15/2026, 2:00 PM"]**

**Voiceover (continued):**  
"Important note: In our new system, you only set the scheduled date here. You don't need to worry about a separate 'completed date'—we'll cover that in a moment."

---

### [3:00-3:20] FIELD 4: INTERVIEWER(S) (OPTIONAL)

**[Action: Click into Interviewer(s) field, type example name]**

**Voiceover:**  
"The Interviewer field is optional but recommended. Enter the name of who will be conducting this interview. This could be you, another recruiter, or a sales manager. You can type multiple names if it's a panel interview."

**[Action: Type "Sarah Johnson" as example]**

---

### [3:20-3:35] FIELD 5: NOTES (OPTIONAL)

**[Action: Click into Notes field, type example text]**

**Voiceover:**  
"The Notes field is also optional. You can add any relevant context here—like 'Follow-up from LinkedIn outreach' or 'Candidate requested afternoon time slot.' These notes help provide context for anyone reviewing the interview later."

---

### [4:25-4:50] COMPLETING AN INTERVIEW

**[Show: Navigate to an interview record or show interview list]**

**Voiceover:**  
"Now, here's an important change from the old system: when the interview is actually held, you simply change the Interview Status to 'Completed.' That's it—no separate completed date field to manage."

**[Action: Show clicking into an interview record, changing Status dropdown from "Scheduled" to "Completed"]**

**Voiceover (continued):**  
"Open the interview record, change the Status from 'Scheduled' to 'Completed,' and save. The system will automatically track when you marked it complete. This is much simpler than the old two-date system."

**[Show: Status changed to "Completed," save button clicked]**

---

### [4:50-5:05] DASHBOARD METRICS UPDATE

**[Show: Dashboard with "Completed Interviews" count increased]**

**Voiceover:**  
"Once you mark interviews as completed, your dashboard metrics update automatically. The 'Completed Interviews' count goes up, and you can toggle between Current Month and Year-to-Date views to see your progress."

**[Action: Show toggling between "Current Month" and "YTD" if applicable]**

---

### [5:05-5:15] CLOSING

**[Show: Dashboard home page]**

**Voiceover:**  
"That's all there is to it! You now know how to schedule interviews and mark them complete. In the next video, we'll walk through the Sales Manager Dashboard and what all the metrics mean. Thanks for watching!"

**[End recording]**

## Key Points to Emphasize

1. ✅ **Quick process** - Less than 1 minute to schedule
2. ✅ **Interview types matter** - Start with Attraction, progress through SI1/SI2/SI3
3. ✅ **Single date field** - Only scheduled date needed (not two separate dates)
4. ✅ **Mark complete when done** - Just change status, no manual date entry
5. ✅ **Dashboard auto-updates** - Metrics reflect scheduled/completed counts in real-time
6. ✅ **Optional fields add value** - Interviewer and Notes help with tracking

---

## Common Mistakes to Address

- ❌ Confusing "scheduled date" with "completed date" (old system had both)
- ❌ Forgetting to mark interviews complete after they happen
- ❌ Not selecting the correct interview type (affects reporting)
- ❌ Scheduling in the past (should be future dates)
- ❌ Creating multiple interviews for the same stage (use one per type per candidate)
