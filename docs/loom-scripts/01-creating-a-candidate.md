## Video Script with Voiceover

### [0:00-0:15] INTRODUCTION

**[Show: Dashboard home page]**

**Voiceover:**  
"Welcome to the Recruiter Portal training series. In this video, I'll show you how to create a new candidate record in just a few simple steps. This is the first step in our recruiting process, and it takes less than 2 minutes to complete."

---

### [0:15-0:30] LOCATING THE CREATE BUTTON

**[Action: Hover over header buttons, then highlight "Create New Candidate" button]**

**Voiceover:**  
"From your dashboard home page, look at the action buttons in the header. You'll see several options here. The fourth button from the left says 'Create New Candidate.' Click this button to get started."

**[Action: Click "Create New Candidate" button]**

---

### [0:30-0:50] MODAL OPENS - OVERVIEW

**[Show: Create Candidate modal open with all fields visible]**

**Voiceover:**  
"The Create Candidate form opens as a modal window. You'll see six fields here. Two of them are required—Full Name and Email Address—indicated by the red asterisk. The other four fields are optional but highly recommended for better tracking. Let's go through each field."

---

### [0:50-1:10] FIELD 1: FULL NAME (REQUIRED)

**[Action: Click into Full Name field, type example: "John Smith"]**

**Voiceover:**  
"First, enter the candidate's Full Name. This is a required field. The system will automatically create a Contact record in Salesforce using this name. So make sure you enter it correctly—first and last name together."

**[Show: Typed "John Smith"]**

---

### [1:10-1:30] FIELD 2: EMAIL ADDRESS (REQUIRED)

**[Action: Click into Email field, type example: "john.smith@email.com"]**

**Voiceover:**  
"Next, enter the candidate's Email Address. This is also required. The system performs an automatic duplicate check based on email—if this email already exists in your Contacts, you'll get a warning to prevent creating duplicates. This helps keep your database clean."

**[Show: Typed email, maybe show duplicate warning if possible, then change to unique email]**

---

### [1:30-1:50] FIELD 3: PHONE NUMBER (OPTIONAL)

**[Action: Click into Phone field, type example: "(555) 123-4567"]**

**Voiceover:**  
"The Phone Number field is optional, but I highly recommend filling it in. This becomes the primary phone number on the Contact record and makes it easy to call candidates directly from Salesforce."

**[Show: Typed phone number]**

---

### [1:50-2:20] FIELD 4: POSITION (OPTIONAL DROPDOWN)

**[Action: Click Position dropdown, show all options]**

**Voiceover:**  
"The Position field lets you specify what role this candidate is being recruited for. Click the dropdown to see all available options."

**[Action: Scroll through dropdown showing:]**

- Insurance Agent (default)
- Senior Insurance Agent
- Insurance Sales Representative
- Account Manager
- Team Lead
- Sales Manager
- Other

**Voiceover (continued):**  
"Most candidates will be 'Insurance Agent'—that's the default. But you can select Senior Agent, Sales Rep, Account Manager, Team Lead, Sales Manager, or Other depending on the role. This helps with reporting and filtering later."

**[Action: Select "Insurance Agent"]**

---

### [2:20-2:50] FIELD 5: LEAD SOURCE (OPTIONAL DROPDOWN)

**[Action: Click Lead Source dropdown, show all options]**

**Voiceover:**  
"Lead Source tells you where this candidate came from. This is valuable for tracking which recruiting channels are most effective."

**[Action: Scroll through dropdown showing:]**

- Recruiter Portal (default)
- LinkedIn
- Indeed
- Monster
- Employee Referral
- Company Website
- Job Fair
- Other

**Voiceover (continued):**  
"You can select Recruiter Portal, LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster, Employee Referral, Company Website, Job Fair, or Other. For example, if you're importing this candidate from LinkedIn, select 'LinkedIn.' If they were referred by another employee, choose 'Employee Referral.'"

**[Action: Select "LinkedIn"]**

---

### [2:50-3:10] FIELD 6: INITIAL NOTES (OPTIONAL)

**[Action: Click into Initial Notes field, type example text]**

**Voiceover:**  
"Finally, the Initial Notes field is a text area where you can capture any important first impressions or context about this candidate. For example, 'Strong communication skills during phone screen' or 'Has 5 years insurance experience.' These notes will be visible on the candidate record."

**[Show: Typed "Interested in insurance sales. Previous experience in financial services. Strong LinkedIn profile."]**

---

### [3:10-3:30] SUBMITTING THE FORM

**[Action: Hover over "Create Candidate" button at bottom of modal]**

**Voiceover:**  
"Once you've filled out all the fields, click the 'Create Candidate' button at the bottom of the form. The system will now create both a Contact record and a Candidate record linked together."

**[Action: Click "Create Candidate" button]**

**[Show: Loading spinner, then success message/modal closes]**

**Voiceover:**  
"You'll see a brief loading indicator, and then the modal closes automatically. Your candidate has been created!"

---

### [3:30-3:50] VERIFICATION & NEXT STEPS

**[Show: Dashboard with updated candidate count, or navigate to Candidates list]**

**Voiceover:**  
"Notice that your dashboard metrics have updated—you should see the candidate count increase. The new candidate is now in your system with a Status of 'New.'"

**[Action: Optional - click into the newly created candidate record to show it exists]**

**Voiceover (continued):**  
"To schedule an interview with this candidate, you'll use the 'Schedule Interview' button in the header—we'll cover that in the next video."

---

### [3:50-4:00] CLOSING

**[Show: Dashboard home page]**

**Voiceover:**  
"That's it! You now know how to create a candidate in the Recruiter Portal. In the next video, we'll cover how to schedule interviews. Thanks for watching!"

**[End recording]**

## Key Points to Emphasize

1. ✅ **Only 2 required fields** - Full Name and Email (makes it quick)
2. ✅ **Duplicate check** - System prevents duplicate emails automatically
3. ✅ **Contact auto-creation** - Creates Contact AND Candidate together
4. ✅ **Position & Lead Source** - Important for reporting and tracking effectiveness
5. ✅ **Initial Notes** - Capture context immediately before you forget
6. ✅ **Two-step process** - Create candidate first, then schedule interview separately (no checkbox option)

---

## Common Mistakes to Address

- ❌ Not checking for duplicates before creating (email check handles this)
- ❌ Entering nickname instead of full legal name
- ❌ Skipping Position and Lead Source (reduces reporting value)
- ❌ Expecting to schedule a call in the same modal (that's a separate step)
