## Reading the Dashboard

> 📊 **Note:** The Current Month / YTD toggle in the Interview Statistics section only affects interview counts. All Contract B Pipeline data (FYC, submissions, days left) always shows current real-time data.

### Step 1: Check Summary Cards

Look at these numbers first:

- **Active Contract B** - How many agents are you tracking?
- **At Risk** - ⚠️ These need immediate attention (should ideally be zero)
- **Requirements Met** - Ready for transition celebration!

**Interactive Features:**

- **Click any summary card** to open a detailed modal showing filtered candidates
- **Auto-refresh:** Dashboard automatically updates with real-time data
- **Priority Focus:** Monitor "At Risk" count daily - take action immediately when it's above zero

### Step 2: Review Pipeline Table

Focus on these columns:

| Column           | What to Check                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Days Left**    | Sort ascending - lowest first need attention  |
| **FYC Progress** | Is the bar growing? Should be >50% at month 2 |
| **Submissions**  | X/5 - Are they on pace?                       |
| **Status**       | Any 🔴 Critical or 🟠 At Risk?                |

### Step 3: Take Action

| Status      | Days Left | Action                                |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 🔴 Critical | <14       | Escalate immediately, daily check-ins |
| 🟠 At Risk  | <30       | Weekly coaching sessions              |
| 🟡 On Track | 30+       | Monthly review                        |
| 🟢 Complete | Any       | Celebrate! Process transition         |

## Weekly Coaching Checklist

For each Contract B agent on your team:

- [ ] Check FYC progress vs. previous week (look for consistent growth)
- [ ] Review submission count (should increase steadily)
- [ ] Identify pipeline opportunities (help find prospects)
- [ ] Discuss obstacles/challenges (remove barriers)
- [ ] Set weekly activity goals (specific and measurable)
- [ ] Document coaching notes (in Salesforce or your system)
- [ ] Verify interview completion (ensure interviews marked "Completed" for accurate metrics)

> 📝 **Tip:** Interview statistics on the dashboard only count interviews with Status = "Completed". Remind recruiters to update interview statuses promptly.
