## âœ… CSS Fixes Applied for Dashboard Readability

I've updated the CSS in your `recruiterDashboard.css` file to fix the readability issues in the top section of the recruiter dashboard:

### ðŸŽ¨ **Changes Made:**

1. **Removed Background Images** - No background images were found, but improved the contrast
2. **Dark Blue Background** - Applied `#003366` background color to the clickable stat items
3. **White Text** - All text in the priority section now uses white color for maximum contrast
4. **Enhanced Hover Effects** - Better visual feedback when hovering over items
5. **Card Styling** - Improved the overall card container styling

### ðŸ“‹ **Specific Updates:**

**Clickable Stat Items:**
- Background: Dark blue (`#003366`)
- Text: White with proper contrast
- Hover: Lighter blue (`#0066cc`) with shadow effects
- Enhanced padding and border radius

**Text Overrides:**
- `.slds-text-heading_large` â†’ White
- `.slds-text-body_regular` â†’ White  
- `.slds-text-body_small` â†’ Semi-transparent white
- `.slds-text-color_success` â†’ Light green (`#90ee90`)
- `.slds-text-color_error` â†’ Light red (`#ffcccb`)

### ðŸš€ **How to Apply:**

The changes are ready in your CSS file at:
`force-app/main/default/lwc/recruiterDashboard/recruiterDashboard.css`

**To deploy (once Apex issues are resolved):**
```bash
sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default/lwc/recruiterDashboard --target-org recruiting-sbx
```

### ðŸ“± **Expected Result:**

The "My Call Management - Priority Section" will now have:
- âœ… Dark blue background instead of unclear/unreadable background
- âœ… Crisp white text that's easy to read
- âœ… Better hover effects for interactivity
- âœ… Consistent styling across all stat items

The deployment is currently blocked by an Apex controller issue, but the CSS changes are ready and will dramatically improve the readability of your dashboard once deployed.

Would you like me to:
1. Fix the Apex deployment issue so we can deploy the CSS changes?
2. Create a standalone CSS file that you can manually copy?
3. Focus on other dashboard improvements?
